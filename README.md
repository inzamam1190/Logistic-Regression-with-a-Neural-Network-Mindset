# Logistic-Regression-with-a-Neural-Network-Mindset
In this notebook we will build a simple image recognition algorithm. We will build a cat classifier that recognizes cats with 70% accuracy! We will: 
- Work with logistic regression in a way that builds intuition relevant to neural networks.  
- Learn how to minimize the cost function.  
- Understand how derivatives of the cost are used to update parameters.
